# 3D Hover Effect
Adds a simple **3D Hover Effect** panel to supported blocks in the Gutenberg editor - just toggle it to enable.
Important: the element receiving the effect should have a defined width; otherwise the result can look off.
For clarity: the plugin saves settings as data-* attributes and adds the card-3d class, which the frontend script/CSS uses to apply the effect.
